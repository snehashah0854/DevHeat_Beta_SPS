# Problem Statement
Kamrej Calling 

# Introduction
This is our project for submission in a 7-day-long Hackathon Devheat-Beta organized by GDSC IIIT SURAT.
We have made a platform that allows the user to generate a bill for the food ordered in the restaurant. It also gives a feature to create individual bills thus making them free of the tedious task of keeping track of everyone's bill amount.

# Frontend

 - HTML<br>
 - CSS<br>
 - Javascript<br><br>

# Project Description

- We have created a website to generate bills with GST calculation included. It asks the user which type of bill he/she wants to generate.<br>
- We have two types of bills. The first one gives the per-head amount of the total bill and the second one generates individual bills for each customer for the particular dishes they have ordered.<br>
- The effective CSS used in the website makes it well-designed and gives an organized user-friendly interface.<br>
- It allows the users to select their desired dishes in just one click as each dish in the menu has its own button.<br>
- The website stores data in an effective way which hence generates the bill in a systematic manner for each individual.<br>
- We have used JavaScript's local storage to store the user inputs. Every button has its own javascript function which accesses the value(rate) of each button(food item) and adds it to the local storage.<br>
- As we click on generate bill button, javascript code fetches the data from the local storage and performs the calculations as specified.<br>
- It then changes the inner HTML of the page and prints the bill in tabular format.
